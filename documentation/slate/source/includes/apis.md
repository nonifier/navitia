===========

<a name="coverage"></a>Coverage
-------------------------------

Also known as `/coverage` service.

You can easily navigate through regions covered by navitia.io, with the
coverage api. The shape of the region is provided in GeoJSON.

In Navitia, a coverage is a combination of multiple [datasets](#datasets)
provided by different [contributors](#contributors)
(typically data provided by a transport authority in GTFS format).
The combination of datasets used by a coverage is arbitrarily determined
but we try to use something that makes sense and has a reasonnable amount of data (country).

The only arguments are the ones of [paging](#paging).

<aside class="notice">
    Most of the time you can avoid providing a region and let Navitia guess the right one for you.
    This can be done by providing coordinates in place of the region name:
    `/coverage/{lon;lat}/endpoint?parameter=value`

|end_production_date   |[iso-date](#iso-date)       | End of the production period. We only have data on this production period |

#### Production period

The production period is the validity period of the coverage's data.

There is no data outside this production period.

This production period cannot exceed one year.

<aside class="notice">
Navitia need transportation data to work and those are very date dependant. To check that a coverage has some data for a given date, you need to check the production period of the coverage.
</aside>

<a name="datasets"></a>Datasets
-------------------------------

Very simple endpoint providing the sets of data that are used in the given coverage.

Those datasets (typically from transport authority in GTFS format), each provided by a
unique [contributor](#contributors) are forming a [coverage](#coverage).

Contributor providing the dataset is also provided in the response.
Very usefull to know all the datas that form a coverage.

The only arguments are the ones of [paging](#paging).

### Accesses

| url | Result |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `coverage/{region_id}/datasets               | List of the datasets of a specific region |
| `coverage/{region_id}/datasets/{dataset_id}  | Information about a specific dataset      |


<a name="contributors"></a>Contributors
-------------------------------

Very simple endpoint providing the contributors of data for the given coverage.

A contributor is a data provider (typically a transport authority), and can provide multiple [datasets](#datasets).
For example, the contributor Italian Railways will provide a dataset for the national train and some others for the regional trains.
We will try to put them in the same [coverage](#coverage) so that we assemble them in the same journey search, using both.

Very usefull to know which contributors are used in the datasets forming a coverage.

The only arguments are the ones of [paging](#paging).

### Accesses

| url | Result |
|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `coverage/{region_id}/contributors               | List of the contributors of a specific region |
| `coverage/{region_id}/contributors/{dataset_id}  | Information about a specific contributor      |

Also known as `/coords` service.

Very simple service: you give Navitia some coordinates, it answers you

-   your detailed postal address
-   the right Navitia "coverage" which allows you to access to all known
    local mobility services

Also known as `/networks`, `/lines`, `/stop_areas`... services.


Once you have selected a region, you can explore the public
transportation objects easily with these APIs. You just need to add at
the end of your URL a collection name to see every objects within a
particular collection. To see an object detail, add the id of this object at the
end of the collection's URL. The [paging](#paging) arguments may be used to
paginate results.

### Accesses

| url                                                     | Result                                                                           |

### Collections

-   [networks](#network)
-   [lines](#line)
-   [routes](#route)
-   [stop_points](#stop-point)
-   [stop_areas](#stop-area)

-   [vehicle_journeys](#vehicle-journey)
-   [disruptions](#disruption)

### Shared parameters

#### <a name="depth"></a>depth

You are looking for something, but Navitia doesn't output it in your favorite endpoint?  
You want to request more from navitia feed?  
You are receiving feeds that are too important and too slow with low bandwidth?  
You would like Navitia to serve GraphQL but it is still not planned?

Feeds from endpoint might miss informations, but this tiny `depth=` parameter can
expand Navitia power by making it more wordy. Or lighter if you want it.

Here is some examples around "metro line 1" from the Parisian network:

- Get "line 1" id
	- <https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/sandbox/pt_objects?q=metro%201>  
	The id is "line:RAT:M1"
- Get routes for this line
	- <https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/sandbox/lines/line:RAT:M1/routes>  
	Default depth is `depth=1`
- Want to get a tiny response? Just add `depth=0`
	- <https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/sandbox/lines/line:RAT:M1/routes?depth=0>  
	The response is lighter (parent lines disappear for example)
- Want more informations, just add `depth=2`
	- <https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/sandbox/lines/line:RAT:M1/routes?depth=2>  
	The response is a little more verbose (some geojson can appear in response when using your open data token)
- Wanna fat more informations, let's try `depth=3`
	- <https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/sandbox/lines/line:RAT:M1/routes?depth=3>  
	Big response: all stop_points are shown
- Wanna spam the internet bandwidth? Try `depth=42`
	- No. There is a technical limit with `depth=3`

#### odt level

-   Type: String
-   Default value: all
-   Warning: works ONLY with */[lines](#line)* collection...

It allows you to request navitia for specific pickup lines. It refers to
the [odt](#odt) section. "odt_level" can take one of these values:

-   all (default value): no filter, provide all public transport lines,
    whatever its type
-   scheduled : provide only regular lines (see the [odt](#odt) section)
-   with_stops : to get regular, "odt_with_stop_time" and "odt_with_stop_point" lines.
    -   You can easily request route_schedule and stop_schedule with these kind of lines.
    -   Be aware of "estimated" stop times
-   zonal : to get "odt_with_zone" lines with non-detailed journeys

For example

<https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-nw/networks/network:lila/lines>

<https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-nw/networks/network:irigo/lines?odt_level=scheduled>

#### distance

-   Type: Integer
-   Default value: 200

If you specify coords in your filter, you can modify the radius used for
the proximity search.

<https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/coords/2.377310;48.847002/stop_schedules?distance=500>

#### headsign

-   Type: String

If given, add a filter on the vehicle journeys that has the given value
as headsign (on vehicle journey itself or at a stop time).

Examples:

-   <https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/vehicle_journeys?headsign=PADO>
-   <https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/stop_areas?headsign=PADO>


<aside class="warning">
    This last request gives the stop areas used by the vehicle
    journeys containing the headsign PADO, <b>not</b> the stop areas where it
    exists a stop time with the headsign PADO.
</aside>

#### since / until

-   Type: [iso-date-time](#iso-date-time)

To be used only on "vehicle_journeys" and "disruptions" collection, to filter on a
period. Both parameters "until" and "since" are optional.

Example:

-   Getting every active New Jersey vehicles between 12h00 and 12h01, on a specific date <https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/us-ny/networks/network:newjersey/vehicle_journeys?since=20170407T120000&until=20170407T120100>
-   Getting every active disruption on "Bretagne" for a specific date <http://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-bre/disruptions?since=20170206000000&until=20170206235959>

<aside class="warning">
    On vehicle_journey this filter is applied using only the first stop time.
    On disruption this filter must intersect with one application period.
    "since" is included and "until" is excluded.
</aside>

#### disable_geojson

By default geojson part of an object are returned in navitia's responses, this parameter allows you to
remove them, it's useful when searching lines that you don't want to display on a map.

<aside class="notice">
    Geojson objects can be very large, 1MB is not unheard of, and they don't compress very well.
    So this parameter is mostly here for reducing your downloading times and helping your json parser.
    It's almost mandatory on mobile devices since most cellular networks are still relatively slow.
</aside>

Examples :

-   <https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/lines?disable_geojson=true>

### <a name="filter"></a>Filter

It is possible to apply a filter to the returned collection, using
"filter" parameter. If no object matches the filter, a "bad_filter"
error is sent. If filter can not be parsed, an "unable_to_parse" error
is sent.

#### {collection}.has_code

>[Try it on Navitia playground](http://canaltp.github.io/navitia-playground/play.html?request=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.navitia.io%2Fv1%2Fcoverage%2Fsandbox%2Fstop_areas%3Ffilter%3Dstop_area.has_code%28source%2CCAMPO%29)

#for any pt_object request, as this one:
$ curl 'https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/sandbox/stop_areas' -H 'Authorization: 3b036afe-0110-4202-b9ed-99718476c2e0'

#you can find codes on every pt_object, like:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
    "stop_areas": [
        {
            "codes" :[
                {
                    "type": "external_code",
                    "value": "RATCAMPO"
                },
                {
                    "type" : "source",
                    "value" : "CAMPO"
                }
            ]
            "...": "...",
        },
        {...}
]

#you can request for objects with a specific code
#for example, you can get this stoparea, having a "source" code "CAMPO"
#by using parameter "filter=stop_area.has_code(source,CAMPO)" like:

$ curl 'https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/sandbox/stop_areas?filter=stop_area.has_code(source,CAMPO)' -H 'Authorization: 3b036afe-0110-4202-b9ed-99718476c2e0'
```

Every object managed by Navitia comes with its own list of ids.
You will find some source ids, merge ids, etc. in "codes" list in json responses.
Be careful, these codes may not be unique. The navitia id is the only unique id.

You may have to request an object by one of these ids, in order to call an external service for example.

The filter format is `filter={collection_name}.has_code({code_type},{code_value})`

Examples :

-   <https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-sw/stop_points?filter=stop_point.has_code(source,5852)>
-   <https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-sw/stop_areas?filter=stop_area.has_code(gtfs_stop_code,1303)>
-   <https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-sw/lines?filter=line.has_code(source,11821949021891619)>

<aside class="warning">
    these ids (which are not Navitia ids) may not be unique. you will have to manage a tuple in response.
</aside>


#### line.code

It allows you to request navitia objects referencing a line whose code
is the one provided, especially lines themselves and routes.

Examples :

-   <https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/lines?filter=line.code=4>
-   <https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/routes?filter=line.code=\"métro\ 347\">

Also known as `/pt_objects` service.

This endpoint allows you to search in public transport objects using their names. It's a kind
of magical [autocomplete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocomplete) on public transport data.
It returns a collection of [pt_object](#pt-object).

### How does it works

Differents kind of objects can be returned (sorted as):

-   network
-   commercial_mode
-   line
-   route
-   stop_area

Here is a typical use case. A traveler has to find a line between the
1500 lines around Paris.

#### Examples

User could type one of the following without any filters:

##### Traveler input "bob":

-  network : "bobby network"
-  line : "bobby bus 1"
-  line : "bobby bus 2"
-  route : "bobby bus 1 to green"
-  route : "bobby bus 1 to rose"
-  route : "bobby bus 2 to yellow"
-  stop_area : "...

##### Traveler input "bobby met":

-  line : "bobby metro 1"
-  line : "bobby metro 11"
-  line : "bobby metro 2"
-  line : "bobby metro 3"
-  route : "bobby metro 1 to Martin"
-  route : "bobby metro 1 to Mahatma"
-  route : "bobby metro 11 to Marcus"
-  route : "bobby metro 11 to Steven"
-  route : "...

##### Traveler input: "bobby met 11" or "bobby metro 11":

-  line : "bobby metro 11"
-  route : "bobby metro 11 to Marcus"
-  route : "bobby metro 11 to Steven"

        "name": "Rue du Bac (Paris)"
        },
        ...
    ],
    "links" : [...],
}
```

Also known as `/places` service.

This endpoint allows you to search in all geographical objects using their names, returning
a [place](#place) collection.

It is very useful to make some [autocomplete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocomplete) stuff ie
to understand the user input even if he has mittens.

Differents kind of objects can be returned (sorted as):

-   administrative_region
-   stop_area
-   poi
-   address
-   stop_point (appears only if specified, using `&type[]=stop_point` filter)

<aside class="warning">
    There is no pagination for this api.

<aside class="notice">
    The returned `quality` field is deprecated and only maintained for backward compatibility.

| `/places`                                      | *Beta*: List of geographical objects within Earth |

<aside class="warning">
    Until now, you have to specify the right coverage to get `/places`.<br>
    If you like to play, you can test the "beta" `/places`, without any coverage:
    it will soon be able to request entire Earth on adresses, POIs, stop areas... with geographical sort.

Also known as `/journeys` service. This api computes journeys or isochrone tables.

There are two ways to access to this service : journeys from point to point, or isochrones from a single point to every point.

<aside class="success">
    Neither the 'from' nor the 'to' parameter of the journey are required,
    but obviously one of them has to be provided.
    <br>
    If only one is defined an isochrone is computed with every possible
    journeys from or to the point.
</aside>

### Accesses

| url | Result |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `/journeys`                          | List of journeys from wherever land     |
| `/coverage/{region_id}/journeys`     | List of journeys on a specific coverage |
| `/coverage/{a_path_to_resource}/journeys`     | Isochrone from a specific coverage |

<aside class="notice">
    Navitia.io handle lot's of different data sets (regions). Some of them
    can overlap. For example opendata data sets can overlap with private
    data sets.
    <br>
    When using the journeys endpoint the data set used to compute the
    journey is chosen using the possible datasets of the origin and the
    destination.
    <br>
    For the moment it is not yet possible to compute journeys on different
    data sets, but it will one day be possible (with a cross-data-set
    system).
</aside>

####Requesting a single journey

The most used way to access to this service is to get the `/journeys` api endpoint.
Here is the structure of a standard journey request:

<https://api.navitia.io/v1/journeys?from={resource_id_1}&to={resource_id_2}&datetime={date_time_to_leave}> .

[Context](#context) object provides the `current_datetime`, useful to compute waiting time when requesting Navitia without a `datetime`.

<aside class="success">
    By default journeys are computed considering a traveler that walks at the beginning and the end.
    <br>
    This can be modified using parameters "first_section_mode" and "last_section_mode" that are arrays.
    <br>
    Example allowing bike or walk at the beginning: <a href="https://api.navitia.io/v1/journeys?from=2.3865494;48.8499182&to=2.3643739;48.854&first_section_mode[]=walking&first_section_mode[]=bike">https://api.navitia.io/v1/journeys?from=2.3865494;48.8499182&to=2.3643739;48.854&first_section_mode[]=walking&first_section_mode[]=bike</a>
</aside>

<a
    href="https://jsfiddle.net/kisiodigital/0oj74vnz/"
    target="_blank"
    class="button button-blue">
    Code it yourself on JSFiddle
</a>

In the [examples](#examples), positions are given by coordinates and no network is specified.
However when no coordinates are provided, you need to provide on what region you want to request as
<https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/us-ca/journeys?from=-122.4752;37.80826&to=-122.402770;37.794682>

The list of regions covered by navitia is available through [coverage](#coverage).

<aside class="notice">
    If you want to use a specific data set, use the journey api within the
    data set: https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/{your_dataset}/journeys
</aside>

####Requesting an isochrone

If you want to retreive every possible journey from a single point at a time, you can request as follow:

<https://api.navitia.io/v1/{a_path_to_resource}/journeys>

It will retrieve all the journeys from the resource (in order to make *[isochrone tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isochrone_map)*).

<a
    href="https://jsfiddle.net/kisiodigital/x6207t6f/"
    target="_blank"
    class="button button-blue">
    Code it yourself on JSFiddle
</a>

The [isochrones](#isochrones) service exposes another response structure, which is simpler, for the same data.

### <a name="journeys-disruptions"></a> Disruptions
By default, Navitia only computes journeys that don't have disruptions, disrupted journeys will not be reported into the response.
If you want to provide journeys without blocking disruptions, you need to use the parameter `data_freshness=realtime`.

In a journey's response, different disruptions may have different meanings.
Each journey has a `status` attribute that indicates the most serious disruption effect.
Disruptions are on the sections, the ones that impact the journey are in the sections's display_informations links  (`sections[].display_informations.links[]`).

You might also have other disruptions in the response. They don't directly impact the journey, but might affect them.
For example, some intermediate stops of a section can be disrupted, it doesn't prevent the journey from being realised but modifies it.
These disruptions won't be on the `display_informations` of the sections or used in the journey's status.

### Precisions on `forbidden_uris[]` and `allowed_id[]`

These parameters are filtering the vehicle journeys and the stop points used to compute the journeys.
`allowed_id[]` is used to allow *only* certain route options by *excluding* all others.
`forbidden_uris[]` is used to *exclude* specific route options.

Examples:

* A user doesn't like line A metro in hers city. She adds the parameter `forbidden_uris[]=line:A` when calling the API.
* A user would only like to use Buses and Tramways. She adds the parameter `allowed_id[]=physical_mode:Bus&allowed_id[]=physical_mode:Tramway`.

### Precisions on `free_radius_from/free_radius_to`

These parameters find the nearest stop point (within free_radius distance) to the given coordinates.
Then, it allows skipping walking sections between the point of departure/arrival and those nearest stop points.

Example:

![image](free_radius.png)

In this example, the stop points within the circle (SP1, SP2 et SP3) can be reached via a crowfly of 0 second. The other stop points, outside the circle, will be reached by walking.


#### Technically

The journeys can only use allowed vehicle journeys (as present in the `public_transport` or `on_demand_transport` sections).
They also can only use the allowed stop points for getting in or out of a vehicle (as present in the `street_network`, `transfer` and `crow_fly` sections).

For filtering vehicle journeys, the identifier of a line, route, commercial mode, physical mode or network can be used. 

For filtering stop points, the identifier of a stop point or stop area can be used.

The principle is to create a blacklist using those 2 parameters:

* `forbidden_uris[]` adds the corresponding vehicle journeys (or stop points) to the blacklist of vehicle journeys (resp. stop_points).

* `allowed_id[]` works in 2 parts:

    * If an id related to a stop point is given, only the corresponding stop points are allowed (practically, all other are blacklisted). Else, all the stop points are allowed.
    * If an id related to a vehicle journey is given, only the corresponding vehicle journeys are allowed (practically, all other are blacklisted). Else, all the vehicle journeys are allowed.

The blacklisting constraints of `forbidden_uris[]` and `allowed_id[]` are combined. For example, if you give `allowed_id[]=network:SN&forbidden_uris[]=line:A`, only the vehicle journeys of the network SN that are not from the line A can be used to compute the journeys.

Let's illustrate all of that with an example.

![example](forbidden_example.png)

We want to go from stop A to stop B. Lines 1 and 2 can go from stop A to B. There is another stop C connected to A with lines 3 and 4, and connected to B with lines 5 and 6.

Without any constraint, all these objects can be used to propose a solution. Let's study some examples:

| `forbidden_uris[]` | `allowed_id[]`         | Result
|--------------------|------------------------|--------
| line 1, line 2     |                        | All the journeys will pass by stop C, using either of line 3, 4, 5 and 6
| stop A             |                        | No solution, as we can't get in any transport
| stop B             |                        | No solution, as we can't get out at destination
|                    | stop C                 | No solution, as we can't get in neither get out
| line 1, line 2     | line 3                 | No solution, as only line 3 can be taken
|                    | line 3, line 5         | All the journeys will pass by stop C using line 3 and 5
|                    | line 3, line 4, line5  | All the journeys will pass by stop C using (line 3 or 4) and line 5
|                    | line 3, line 5, stop C | No solution, as we can't get in neither get out
|                    | stop A, stop C, stop B | As without any constraint, passing via stop C is not needed
| stop A, stop B     | stop A, stop B         | No solution, as no stop point are allowed.

This service gives you a multi-polygon response which
represents a same duration travel zone at a given time: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isochrone_map

As you can find isochrone tables using `/journeys`, this service is only another representation
of the same data, map oriented.

It is also really usefull to make filters on geocoded objects in order to find which ones are reachable at a given time within a specific duration.
You just have to verify that the coordinates of the geocoded object are inside the multi-polygon.

### <a name="isochrones-parameters"></a>Main parameters

<aside class="success">
    'from' and 'to' parameters works as exclusive parameters:
    <li>When 'from' is provided, 'to' is ignored and Navitia computes a "departure after" isochrone.
    <li>When 'from' is not provided, 'to' is required and Navitia computes a "arrival after" isochrone.
</aside>

<aside class="notice">
    Isochrones are time dependant. The duration boundary is actually an arrival time boundary.
    'datetime' parameter is therefore important: The result is not the same when computing

|-----------|-------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| nop       | from                    | id            | The id of the departure of your journey. Required to compute isochrones "departure after" |               |
| nop       | to                      | id            | The id of the arrival of your journey. Required to compute isochrones "arrival before"    |               |
| yep       | datetime                | [iso-date-time](#iso-date-time) | Date and time to go                                                                          |               |
| yep       | boundary_duration[]  | int   | A duration delineating a reachable area (in seconds). Using multiple boundary makes map more readable |      |
| nop       | forbidden_uris[]        | id            | If you want to avoid lines, modes, networks, etc.</br> Note: the forbidden_uris[] concern only the public transport objects. You can't for example forbid the use of the bike with them, you have to set the fallback modes for this (`first_section_mode[]` and `last_section_mode[]`)                                                 |               |
| nop       | first_section_mode[]    | array of string   | Force the first section mode if the first section is not a public transport one. It takes one the following values: `walking`, `car`, `bike`, `bss`.<br>`bss` stands for bike sharing system.<br>It's an array, you can give multiple modes.<br><br>Note: choosing `bss` implicitly allows the `walking` mode since you might have to walk to the bss station.<br> Note 2: The parameter is inclusive, not exclusive, so if you want to forbid a mode, you need to add all the other modes.<br> Eg: If you never want to use a `car`, you need: `first_section_mode[]=walking&first_section_mode[]=bss&first_section_mode[]=bike&last_section_mode[]=walking&last_section_mode[]=bss&last_section_mode[]=bike` | walking |
| nop       | last_section_mode[]     | array of string   | Same as first_section_mode but for the last section  | walking     |

### Tips

#### Understand the resulting isochrone

The principle of isochrones is to work like journeys.
So if one doesn't understand why a place is inside or outside an isochrone,
please compute a journey from the "center" of isochrone to that precise place.

To do that, just 3 changes are needed:

- provide a starting `datetime=` to compare arrival time evenly
- change endpoint: `/isochrones` to `/journeys`
- provide a destination using `&to=<my_place>`

Please remember that isochrones use crowfly at the end so they are less precise than journeys.

#### Isochrones without public transport

The main goal of Navitia is to handle public transport, so it's not recommended to avoid them.  
However if your are willing to do that, you can use a little trick and
pass the parameters `&allowed_id=physical_mode:Bus&forbidden_id=physical_mode:Bus`.
You will only get circles.

#### Car isochrones

Using car in Navitia isochrones is not recommended.  
It is only handled for compatibility with `/journeys` but tends to squash every other result.

Also known as `/stop_schedules` service.

This endpoint gives you access to time tables going through a stop
point as:
![stop_schedules](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Panneau_SIEL_couleurs_Paris-Op%C3%A9ra.jpg/640px-Panneau_SIEL_couleurs_Paris-Op%C3%A9ra.jpg)

The response is made of an array of [stop_schedule](#stop-schedule), and another
one of [note](#note).
[Context](#context) object provides the `current_datetime`, useful to compute waiting time when requesting Navitia without a `from_datetime`.

Also known as `/departures` service.

This endpoint retrieves a list of departures from a specific datetime of a selected
object.
[Context](#context) object provides the `current_datetime`, useful to compute waiting time when requesting Navitia without a `from_datetime`.
Departures are ordered chronologically in ascending order as:

Line_reports is an array of some line_report object.

One Line_report object is a complex object, made of a line, and an array
of [pt_objects](#pt-objects) linked (for example stop_areas, stop_point or network). 

#### What a **complete** response **means**

-   multiple line_reports
    -   line 1
          -   stop area concorde > internal link to disruption "green"
          -   stop area bastille > internal link to disruption "pink"
    -   line 2 > internal link to disruption "blue"
          -   network RATP > internal link to disruption "green"
          -   line 2 > internal link to disruption "blue"
    -   line 3 > internal link to disruption "yellow"
          -   stop point bourse > internal link to disruption "yellow"
-   multiple disruptions (disruption target links)
    -   disruption "green"
    -   disruption "pink"
    -   disruption "blue"
    -   disruption "yellow"
    -   Each disruption contains the messages to show.

Details for disruption objects : [disruptions](#disruptions)

#### What a line_report object **contains**

-   1 line which is the grouping object
    -   it can contain links to its disruptions.  
    These disruptions are globals and might not be applied on stop_areas and stop_points. 
-   1..n pt_objects
    -   each one contains at least a link to its disruptions.

Traffic_reports is an array of some traffic_report object.

One traffic_report object is a complex object, made of a network, an array
of lines and an array of stop_areas.

#### What a **complete** response **means**

-   multiple traffic_reports
    -   network "bob"
          -   line "1" > internal link to disruption "green"
          -   line "12" > internal link to disruption "pink"
          -   stop_area "bobito" > internal link to disruption "red"
    -   network "bobette" > internal link to disruption "blue"
          -   line "A" > internal link to disruption "green"
          -   line "C" > internal link to disruption "yellow"
          -   stop_area "bobito" > internal link to disruption "red"
-   multiple disruptions (disruption target links)
    -   disruption "green"
    -   disruption "pink"
    -   disruption "red"
    -   disruption "blue"
    -   disruption "yellow"
    -   Each disruption contains the messages to show.

Details for disruption objects : [disruptions](#disruptions)

#### What a traffic_report object **contains**

-   1 network which is the grouping object
    -   it can contain links to its disruptions.  
    These disruptions are globals and might not be applied on lines or stop_areas.
-   0..n lines
    -   each line contains at least a link to its disruptions
-   0..n stop_areas
    -   each stop_area contains at least a link to its disruptions  
    If a stop_area is used by multiple networks, it will appear each time.
